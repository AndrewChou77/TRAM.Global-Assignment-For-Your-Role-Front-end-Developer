Overviewï¼š
This a user management application that allows an admin to create a user profile. Admin could enter First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone number etc (not limited to) of the users during the profile creation and will be able to see the list of all the users in the system at one place. Admin should be able to edit a user profile later, if needed. Admin should also be able to delete a user profile all together.

App Features:
1. Proper form validation in both user-created and user-edited forms.
2. There are edit and delete icons behind each user record.
